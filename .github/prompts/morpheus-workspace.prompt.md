# Morpheus High Availability AWS Deployment Guide

## Architecture Overview

A three-node HA Morpheus deployment consists of these primary tiers:

### Application Tier
- Three Morpheus application nodes
- Running stateless services (Nginx and Tomcat)
- Load balanced for high availability

### Database Tiers
- **Transactional**: Amazon Aurora MySQL cluster
- **Non-Transactional**: Amazon OpenSearch cluster
  - Handles logs and metrics storage

### Supporting Services
- **Message Queue**: Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ)
- **Shared Storage**: Amazon EFS
  - Stores deployment archives
  - Houses virtual images
  - Maintains backups

## AWS Services Integration

### Core Services
- **Amazon Aurora**
  - MySQL-compatible database
  - Built-in high availability
  - Automated backups

- **Amazon OpenSearch Service**
  - Managed Elasticsearch
  - Scalable log storage
  - Metric management

- **Amazon MQ**
  - Managed RabbitMQ
  - Message queue clustering
  - High availability configuration

- **Elastic File System**
  - NFS-compatible storage
  - Multi-AZ access
  - Automatic scaling

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Network Configuration
- VPC setup across multiple AZs
- Private and public subnets
- Security group configuration
- Load balancer distribution

### 2. Database Layer
- Aurora cluster deployment
