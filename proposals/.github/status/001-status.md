## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Security

- Risk: Credential exposure
  - Mitigation: Using AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation
- Risk: Unauthorized access
  - Mitigation: Strict security groups and IAM policies

### Reliability

- Risk: Service interruption
  - Mitigation: Multi-AZ deployment, auto-scaling
- Risk: Data loss
  - Mitigation: Automated backups, point-in-time recovery

### Performance

- Risk: Resource contention
  - Mitigation: Auto-scaling policies, monitoring
- Risk: Database bottlenecks
  - Mitigation: Read replicas, connection pooling

### Cost

- Risk: Unexpected charges
  - Mitigation: Budget alerts, resource tagging
- Risk: Over-provisioning
  - Mitigation: Right-sizing instances, auto-scaling

## Timeline

1. Week 1-2: Documentation and runbook creation
2. Week 3-4: Backup and DR implementation
3. Week 5-6: Monitoring and alerting enhancement
4. Week 7-8: Performance optimization and testing

## Recommendations

1. Implement automated testing for infrastructure changes
2. Set up centralized logging and monitoring
3. Create automated deployment pipelines
4. Establish regular security review process
5. Implement cost optimization strategies
