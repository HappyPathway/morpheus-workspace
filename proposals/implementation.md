  max_size = 6
  desired_capacity = 3

  # Load Balancer Integration
  target_group_arns = [...]

  # Networking
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets

  # Security
  security_group_ids = [...]
}
```

### terraform-aws-rds

```hcl
module "morpheus_db" {
  source = "./terraform-aws-rds"

  engine = "aurora-mysql"
  engine_version = "8.0"

  cluster_instances = {
    1 = {
      instance_class = "db.r5.xlarge"
      promotion_tier = 1
    }
    2 = {
      instance_class = "db.r5.xlarge"
      promotion_tier = 2
    }
  }

  backup_retention_period = 7
  preferred_backup_window = "03:00-04:00"
}
```

### terraform-aws-opensearch-cluster

```hcl
module "morpheus_opensearch" {
  source = "./terraform-aws-opensearch-cluster"

  domain_name = "morpheus-logs"
  engine_version = "OpenSearch_2.5"

  cluster_config = {
    instance_type = "r6g.large.search"
    instance_count = 3
    zone_awareness_enabled = true
  }
}
```

### terraform-aws-mq-cluster

```hcl
module "morpheus_mq" {
  source = "./terraform-aws-mq-cluster"

  broker_name = "morpheus-rabbitmq"
  engine_type = "RabbitMQ"
  engine_version = "3.10.10"

  host_instance_type = "mq.m5.large"
  deployment_mode = "CLUSTER_MULTI_AZ"
}
```

### terraform-aws-efs

```hcl
module "morpheus_efs" {
  source = "./terraform-aws-efs"

  creation_token = "morpheus-shared-storage"
  performance_mode = "generalPurpose"
  throughput_mode = "bursting"
  encrypted = true
}
```

## 3. Integration Requirements

### Service Dependencies

1. EFS must be mounted on all application nodes
2. RDS endpoints must be accessible to application nodes
3. RabbitMQ credentials must be configured in application
4. OpenSearch endpoints must be configured for logging

### Security Requirements

1. All inter-service communication must use security groups
2. Data at rest must be encrypted using KMS
3. Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS
4. IAM roles must follow least privilege principle

### Monitoring Setup

1. CloudWatch metrics for all services
2. CloudWatch alarms for critical thresholds
3. CloudWatch logs for application and service logs
4. Health checks for all components

## 4. Deployment Strategy

### Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] VPC and networking prerequisites
- [ ] IAM roles and policies
- [ ] KMS keys
- [ ] Security groups
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates

### Deployment Order

1. Network infrastructure
2. Storage (EFS)
3. Database (RDS)
4. Message Queue (MQ)
5. Search (OpenSearch)
6. Load Balancer
7. Application Cluster

### Post-deployment Validation

1. Health check all services
2. Verify multi-AZ functionality
3. Test failover scenarios
4. Validate backup systems
5. Verify monitoring and alerting
