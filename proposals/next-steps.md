# Next Steps for Morpheus HA Implementation

## Current State Analysis

Based on review of existing proposals and implementation documents, here is our current state:

### Strengths

- Well-defined module structure and dependencies
- Comprehensive security considerations in proposals
- Clear high availability requirements documented
- Detailed performance configurations specified
- Strong monitoring and logging proposals

### Areas Needing Immediate Attention

1. **Configuration Management**

   - Need to implement configuration management for application tier
   - User data scripts require templating and testing
   - System limits and JVM configurations need to be automated

2. **Monitoring Implementation**

   - CloudWatch agent configuration needs to be templated
   - Custom metrics for application monitoring not yet implemented
   - Alarm thresholds need to be defined and implemented

3. **Security Implementation**
   - IAM roles need refinement for least privilege
   - KMS key policies require service-specific permissions
   - Secrets management solution needed for credentials

## Immediate Action Items (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Configuration Implementation

```hcl
module "morpheus_cluster" {
  # Configuration management additions needed:
  # - User data templating
  # - CloudWatch agent configuration
  # - System limits setup
  # - JVM tuning parameters
}
```

#### Tasks:

- [ ] Create user data templates for instance configuration
- [ ] Implement CloudWatch agent configuration
- [ ] Add system limits configuration
- [ ] Configure JVM settings through user data

### 2. Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Implement CloudWatch agent configuration
- [ ] Set up custom metrics for:
  - Application health
  - JVM metrics
  - System resources
  - Queue depths
- [ ] Configure CloudWatch alarms with proper thresholds
- [ ] Set up log group structure

### 3. Security Enhancements

- [ ] Review and update IAM roles
- [ ] Implement AWS Secrets Manager integration
- [ ] Configure KMS key policies for all services
- [ ] Implement security group refinements

## Medium-Term Tasks (2-4 Weeks)

### 1. Backup and Recovery

- [ ] Implement automated backup procedures
- [ ] Create backup verification process
- [ ] Document restore procedures
- [ ] Test recovery scenarios

### 2. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling thresholds
- [ ] Set up performance baselines
- [ ] Create load testing procedures

### 3. Documentation

- [ ] Create operational runbooks
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Document backup/restore procedures

## Long-Term Considerations (1-2 Months)

### 1. Cost Optimization

- [ ] Implement cost allocation tags
- [ ] Set up cost monitoring
- [ ] Configure cost anomaly detection
- [ ] Review resource utilization patterns

### 2. Disaster Recovery

- [ ] Implement cross-region backup strategy
- [ ] Create DR procedures
- [ ] Test failover scenarios
- [ ] Document RTO/RPO achievements

### 3. Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Set up regular security audits
- [ ] Implement automated compliance checking
- [ ] Create performance testing schedule
- [ ] Establish regular review cycles
